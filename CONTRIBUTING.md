## How to Contribute

### Reporting Bugs

Before creating bug reports, please check the issue tracker to avoid duplicates. When creating a bug report, include:

- **Clear title and description**
- **Steps to reproduce** the issue
- **Expected behavior** vs actual behavior
- **Screenshots or videos** if applicable
- **Environment details** (OS, Godot version, etc.)

### Suggesting Enhancements

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as GitHub issues. When creating an enhancement suggestion, include:

- **Clear and descriptive title**
- **Detailed description** of the proposed feature
- **Rationale** - why this enhancement would be useful
- **Possible implementation** ideas (optional)

### Your First Code Contribution

Unsure where to begin? Look for issues labeled:

- `good first issue` - Simple issues perfect for beginners
- `help wanted` - Issues where we need community help
- `beginner-friendly` - Issues suitable for new contributors

## Development Workflow

1. **Create a new branch** for your feature or fix:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   git checkout -b fix/bug-description
   ```

2. **Make your changes** following our coding standards

3. **Test your changes** thoroughly in Godot

4. **Commit your changes** with clear, descriptive messages

5. **Push to your fork**:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

6. **Open a Pull Request** against the `main` branch

## Coding Standards

### GDScript Style Guide

Follow the [official GDScript style guide](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/scripting/gdscript/gdscript_styleguide.html):

- **Indentation**: Use tabs (default in Godot)
- **Naming conventions**:
  - Variables and functions: `snake_case`
  - Constants: `UPPER_CASE`
  - Classes: `PascalCase`
  - Private variables/functions: prefix with `_`
- **Line length**: Keep lines under 100 characters when possible
- **Comments**: Use clear, concise comments to explain complex logic

Example:
```gdscript
extends CharacterBody2D

const MAX_HEALTH = 100
var current_health: int = MAX_HEALTH
var _is_dead: bool = false

func take_damage(amount: int) -> void:
    current_health -= amount
    if current_health <= 0:
        _die()

func _die() -> void:
    _is_dead = true
    queue_free()
```

### Project Organization

- Place scripts in appropriate directories (e.g., `scripts/player/`, `scripts/enemies/`)
- Keep scenes organized by type (e.g., `scenes/characters/`, `scenes/ui/`)
- Use clear, descriptive file names
- Group related assets together

## Commit Guidelines

### Commit Message Format

Follow the conventional commits format:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

```

**Types:**
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
