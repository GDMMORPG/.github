# Security Policy

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

The security of the Godot MMORPG project is important to us. If you discover a security vulnerability, we appreciate your help in disclosing it to us in a responsible manner.

### üîí How to Report a Security Issue

**Please DO NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it through our Discord server:

1. **Join our Discord server** - [Discord Invite Link](https://discord.gg/your-discord-link)
2. **Create a ticket** in the **#security-ticket** channel
3. **Provide details** about the vulnerability, including:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce the issue
   - Potential impact
   - Any suggested fixes (if applicable)

### Why Not GitHub Issues?

We ask that security vulnerabilities **not** be reported through the GitHub issue tracker because:

- GitHub issues are **publicly visible**
- Public disclosure of security vulnerabilities can put our users and the project at risk
- We need time to assess and fix the vulnerability before it becomes public knowledge

### What to Expect

After you submit a security ticket through Discord:

1. **Acknowledgment** - We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 48 hours
2. **Assessment** - We will assess the vulnerability and determine its severity
3. **Communication** - We will keep you updated on our progress
4. **Resolution** - Once fixed, we will coordinate the disclosure timeline with you
5. **Credit** - With your permission, we will publicly credit you for the responsible disclosure

### Scope

This security policy applies to:

- The main game codebase
- Server infrastructure and networking code
- Authentication and user data handling
- Any official plugins or extensions

### Safe Harbor

We support safe harbor for security researchers who:

- Make a good faith effort to avoid privacy violations, data destruction, and interruption or degradation of our services
- Only interact with accounts you own or with explicit permission of the account holder
- Do not exploit a vulnerability beyond what is necessary to demonstrate it
- Report vulnerabilities promptly
- Keep vulnerability details confidential until we've had a reasonable time to address them

We will not pursue legal action against researchers who follow these guidelines.

## Security Best Practices for Contributors

When contributing to this project, please:

- **Never commit secrets** (API keys, passwords, tokens) to the repository
- **Validate all user input** to prevent injection attacks
- **Use secure communication** protocols for networking code
- **Follow secure coding practices** as outlined in our contributing guidelines
- **Keep dependencies updated** to patch known vulnerabilities
- **Review code carefully** for potential security issues before submitting PRs

## Questions?

If you have questions about this security policy or need clarification, please:

- Ask in the Discord server (not in security-related channels if it's a general question)
- Contact project maintainers directly
